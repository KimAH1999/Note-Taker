# Career Connection

## Career Connection

Congratulations! You've learned how to work with Web APIs and DOM manipulation, meaning that you can now use JavaScript to manipulate data on the page. No longer do prospective employers stare at static blocks of text on your portfolio website&mdash;instead, they can scroll past dynamic graphics and cards and can contact you with the click of a button.

### Becoming Employer-Competitive

You might remember that most students who achieve employer-competitive status find development jobs within six months after they complete the boot camp. How can you use the material you’ve learned this week to become more employer-competitive?

#### Step #1: Make Your Portfolio More Dynamic

Consider which DOM methods might help you create a more dynamic portfolio. For example, you might use `setTimeout` to delay some text appearing on the page or `setInterval` to do something on a regular basis while someone views your portfolio.

#### Step #2: Link a PDF of Your Resume to Your Portfolio

Making a PDF of your resume available for download enables companies to easily disseminate your profile among their hiring managers. Make this downloadable with the click of a button, and make it easy to find.

### Look to the Future

Start thinking about how you might use your new JavaScript skills to better the world&mdash;or at least to benefit the company that employs you as a web developer! 

You’ve started building your portfolio, and hopefully you’ve even started writing that technical resume. Those steps are essential, but you also need to know where to find job opportunities!

Many job openings don’t even get posted; they’re mostly found through networking, building relationships, and connecting with people who are looking to hire developers. Do these next couple of networking tasks today so that you can snag that job just a few months from now.

**Task #1: On LinkedIn, connect with five people at companies you're interested in.**

If you’ve never used LinkedIn before, don’t be shy! Sign up for a new account or log in at LinkedIn.com. Take time to browse the site&mdash;you can send and receive messages, post statuses, and make connections, just like on other social media platforms. Just remember, LinkedIn is a professional networking platform, so reserve those cute kitty GIFs for your Instagram.

Once you’ve acquainted yourself with the platform, search for local companies that you'd like to work for. You can see who else follows these companies and even who works there. Find someone who might have insights into the company, with a title like Technical Recruiter, HR Manager, or Senior Developer. Request to connect with them, and write a personal message introducing yourself. 

Here's an example:

> Good afternoon, [employee name]. My name is [your name]. I’m reaching out because I live in the area and I’m a new web developer looking to network with professionals in the field, like you. I'm particularly interested in working for [company name] because [add reasons why you'd like to work here], and I was wondering if you could tell me what you love about working there. Thanks for connecting with me!

Do with this with five or six employees at different companies that interest you.

**Task #2: Follow desired companies on social media.**

Companies with a customer-facing or public presence might also use Facebook, Instagram, and other social media sites, in addition to LinkedIn. Start following companies that interest you on these platforms. For example, if cloud computing interests you, you might follow Amazon Web Services (AWS) or Digital Ocean.

Taking this step will build up your feed with technical content, allowing you to engage in more conversations in the industry you’re joining!

### Prepare for the Technical Interview

Many companies introduce algorithm questions during the technical interview. We strongly recommend that you practice these. Doing so will prepare you to handle some of the most common questions in an interview or promotion discussion. 

Please refer to the class repository to find these algorithms:

-   Coding Algorithm #1: Log Even Nums

-   Coding Algorithm #2: Countdown

-   Coding Algorithm #3: Sum Array

For practice in a live, interview-style IDE complete the following algorithm challenge. The solution will be discussed in the weekly recommended session.

Once you start, you'll have seven days to complete it. After seven days, the challenge will close.
