# Unit 01: HTML, CSS, and Git

## Overview

At the heart of every website is **HTML**, or **Hypertext Markup Language**. As the standard language used to build the structure of a webpage, HTML allows us to define elements like paragraphs, images, links, forms, and more.

**Cascading Style Sheets**, or **CSS**, is used to add styling to the elements created with HTML. CSS determines how elements are presented on the page, including font, color, size, positioning of elements, and even animation. 

In this unit, you'll learn how to build webpages that use HTML and CSS to define the structure and style. You'll also be introduced to Git, a version control system that stores your code and its history, as well as separate versions of the code. As the building blocks of web development, these are essential skills and tools that you'll use throughout your career.

## Learning Objectives

You will be employer-ready if you are able to:

* Navigate your computerâ€™s file system and create directories and files using command-line tools.

* Create and clone a repository, add and commit changes, and push and pull code using Git commands.

* Build the structure of a webpage using HTML elements.

* Add attributes to HTML elements to style the elements or adjust their behavior in various ways.

* Style webpages using CSS's `color` and `font` properties.

* Identify the box model and how it relates to an element's layout and design. 

* Alter the layout of webpages using CSS's `display` and `font` properties.

## Technical Interview Preparation

You will be employer-competitive if you are able to solve the following algorithms and successfully complete the assessments.

### Algorithms

Practicing algorithm-based interview questions is one of the best ways to prepare for interviews. Watch the `ðŸ“¹ Let's Code` video(s) for tips and tricks on how to best solve algorithm problems.

## Homework

Accessibility is an increasingly important consideration in web design. Inclusive design aims to ensure that all users&mdash;including those with disabilities&mdash;can interact with and understand the content of a webpage.

For this week's homework, you will use your new HTML and CSS skills to ensure that an existing site is accessible, according to the provided guidelines.
