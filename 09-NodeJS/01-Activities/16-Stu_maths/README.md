# 🐛 Implement Modules

Work with a partner to resolve the following issue(s):

* Users should be able to import and use the `maths.js` module to execute simple math operations.

## Expected Behavior

* When I run `node index.js sum 3 4` in the command line, it should print out `7`

* When I run `node index.js difference 3 4` in the command line, it should print out `-1`

* When I run `node index.js product 3 4` in the command line, it should print out `12`

* When I run `node index.js quotient 3 4` in the command line, it should print out `0.75`

## Actual Behavior

* Nothing happens when I run the commands because the `index.js` file is empty

## Steps to Reproduce the Problem

1. Navigate to the `Unsolved` folder in the command line.

2. Run `node index.js sum 3 4` in the command line.
