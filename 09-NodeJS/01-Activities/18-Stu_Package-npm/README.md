# 📖 Initialize Projects using Node Package Manager (npm)

Work with a partner to implement the following user story:

* As a developer, I want to be able to keep track of dependencies using `npm`.

* As a developer, I want to initialize my project and create a `package.json` file.

* As a developer, I want to be able to save packages to my project.

## Acceptance Criteria

* It's done when I see the `package.json` file created in the [Unsolved](./Unsolved/) folder.

* It's done when I have installed the `inquirer` package successfully and see it listed in the `package.json` file.

* It's done when I see the `node_modules` folder and `package-lock.json` file in the [Unsolved](./Unsolved/) folder.

## 📝 Notes

Refer to the documentation:

* [npm-init](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v6/commands/npm-init)

* [npm-install](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v6/commands/npm-install)

## 💡 Hints

It's possible that the `node_modules` folder is hidden in the `files.exclude` setting in VS Code, so don't let that throw you off if you don't see it.

## 🏆 Bonus

If you have completed this activity, work through the following challenge with your partner to further your knowledge:

* How does the `-y` flag save us some time when running `npm init`? What does the `-g` flag do when running `npm install`?

* What is `npx` and how is it different from `npm install`?
