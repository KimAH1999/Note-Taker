# 🏗️ Implement Template Literals

Work with a partner to implement the following user story:

* As a developer, I want to know how to use template literals inside of a string.

## Acceptance Criteria

* It's done when I have created a `music` object in `Unsolved/index.js`.

* It's done when I have added `title`, `artist`, and `album` properties to the `music` object.

* It's done when I have used template literals inside the `songSnippet` variable to output data from the `music` object.

* It's done when I see the results in my command line after I run the `index.js` file.

## 💡 Hints

* Can we use template literals in place of string concatenation?

## 🏆 Bonus

If you have completed this activity, work through the following challenge with your partner to further your knowledge:

* It's easy to get confused about which syntax belongs to which technology. The dollar sign (`$`) is used a lot in JavaScript&mdash;what are some other places you have seen the dollar sign used?
