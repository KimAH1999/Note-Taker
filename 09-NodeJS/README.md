# Unit 09: Node.js

## Overview

Youâ€™ve arrived at another important milestone in your journey. The JavaScript you wrote for your first project was executed entirely on the client side, though it used third-party server-side APIs. In this and later units, youâ€™ll learn how to write your own server-side applications to handle requests and ultimately to build your own APIs.

In a previous era, this would be the point when youâ€™d begin learning a second programming language, like PHP, to write server-side code. Luckily, Node.js&mdash;released in 2009&mdash;makes this unnecessary. Node.js is an implementation of the V8 JavaScript engine without Chrome. It allows you to write server-side code using JavaScript. This means that you no longer need a browser to run JavaScript. You can (and will) do so from the command line!

In this unit, youâ€™ll learn how to initialize a Node.js project, install third-party dependencies, and create interactive command-line applications. Node.js ships with a **standard library**. The standard library contains a number of modules that allow you to extend the functionality of Node.js, like `fs`, which youâ€™ll use to read and write files. Youâ€™ll also learn how to add a large and robust ecosystem of third-party modules to applications to extend their functionality.

## Learning Objectives

You will be employer-ready if you are able to: 

* Build interactive command-line applications that process user input.

* Explain modularization and how it relates to npm and the standard library.

* Initialize new Node.js projects with npm, and install and import dependencies.

* Explain the importance and usefulness of ES6+ concepts such as `let`, `const`, and arrow functions.

* Handle asynchronicity with callbacks and Promises.

## Technical Interview Preparation

You will be employer-competitive if you are able to solve the following algorithms and successfully complete the assessments.

### Algorithms

Practicing algorithm-based interview questions is one of the best ways to prepare for interviews.

* [01: Character Count](./03-Algorithms/01-character-count/README.md)

	* [ðŸ“¹ Let's Code Character Count!](https://2u-20.wistia.com/medias/6ka87l3z21)

* [02: Product of Largest Two](./03-Algorithms/02-product-of-largest-two/README.md)

* [03: Camel Case](./03-Algorithms/03-camel-case/README.md)

### Assessments

Assess your knowledge by answering technical interview questions and solving coding challenges.
