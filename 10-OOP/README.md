# Unit 10: Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

## Overview

In this unit, we'll discuss object-oriented programming in JavaScript as we learn about constructors and the prototype chain. **Constructors** are special functions that help us create objects of similar types. **Prototypes** are JavaScriptâ€™s built-in system that allows objects to inherit features from other objects. Additionally, we'll explore Promises and learn how to take full advantage of them.

> **On the Job:** Prototypes are generally considered an advanced JavaScript concept. Mastering this concept will make you a more competitive JavaScript developer!

We'll also cover **test-driven development (TDD)**, which involves writing tests for application features before writing any code. Then we write only the minimum amount of code needed to make the tests pass&mdash;and repeat this process until the application is complete. Among its many benefits, test-driven development helps us write more understandable and maintainable code.

We'll conclude this unit with an introduction to modern class syntax and inheritance. ES6 introduced a `class` keyword, which allows us to create objects that use class structures like those found in other OOP programming languages. Essentially, classes are just constructor functions with more intuitive syntax. They allow us to implement more advanced OOP patterns, like inheritance, without needing to understand every aspect of JavaScript's prototypal inheritance system.

## Learning Objectives

You will be employer-ready if you are able to:

* Create more scalable applications that follow the OOP paradigm.

* Create new objects using constructor functions.

* Add methods to objects using prototypical inheritance.

* Explain polymorphism through method overloading.

* Implement `Promise.all()` to wait for multiple API calls.

* Verify that your code works as intended through the use of automated tests.

* Build applications using test-driven development&mdash;writing tests before implementing functionality.

* Implement ES6 classes to create new instances of objects.

* Extend basic classes with additional functionality.

* Implement multiple classes with different purposes to practice the OOP paradigm.

## Technical Interview Preparation

You will be employer-competitive if you are able to solve the following algorithms and successfully complete the assessments.

### Algorithms

Practicing algorithm-based interview questions is one of the best ways to prepare for interviews. Watch the `ðŸ“¹ Let's Code` video for tips and tricks on how to solve the algorithm.

* [01: Linear Search](./03-Algorithms/01-linear-search)

* [02: Is Unique](./03-Algorithms/02-is-unique)

* [03: Is Anagram](./03-Algorithms/03-is-anagram)

  * ðŸ“¹ [Let's Code Is Anagram!](https://2u-20.wistia.com/medias/8hnpk2wu29)

### Assessments

Assess your knowledge by answering technical interview questions and solving coding challenges.

## Homework

In this unit's homework, you'll create an application that generates HTML files using input from a command-line interface. The application will gather information about your team or organization, and you'll be able to add as many team members as you want.

## Career Connection

Career services material for this unit is located in the [Career Connection folder](./04-Career-Connection/README.md). For more information about career services, including coding milestones, demo days, technical toolkits, workshops, and additional resources, visit the [career services website](https://careernetwork.2u.com/?utm_medium=Academics&utm_source=boot_camp/).

## Heads-Up

In the upcoming unit, you will be using an application called Insomnia to make requests to routes you create with Express.js. Be sure to install Insomnia on your computer by visiting the link to the [Insomnia download page](https://insomnia.rest/download) before the end of this unit.

In the next unit, you'll start using Heroku to host your web applications. Be sure to have the Heroku CLI installed on your computer BEFORE class. You can refer to the [Heroku CLI installation guide on the Full-Stack Blog](https://coding-boot-camp.github.io/full-stack/heroku/how-to-install-the-heroku-cli) for extra guidance.
