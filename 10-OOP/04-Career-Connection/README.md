# Career Connection

## Career Connection

The object-oriented programming and test-driven development concepts that you're learning now are vital to your future programming career, and you’ll encounter them frequently during the interviewing process. 

Let's examine the roles that they might play in your job search.

### Object-Oriented Programming

Object-oriented programming is **language-agnostic**: for the most part, no matter which language you’re programming in, the principles are the same. You're already familiar with Node.js, and now you're learning how to implement object-oriented coding standards in JavaScript. But actually, beyond JavaScript, these principles are often more important in other languages.

JavaScript is a **functional programming language**. In other words, you can write JavaScript without classes and inheritance (and other OOP functionalities). But in languages like C# and Java (and many others), you can ONLY write code within an object-oriented paradigm.

But why bother with OOP if you're learning JavaScript and you want a full-stack JavaScript job? Well, even if you want a career in full-stack JavaScript programming, other languages might be in higher market demand. So you could easily find yourself interviewing for positions that require knowledge of object-oriented programming!

### Test-Driven Development

Some developers argue that no one has time to write tests as well as code, especially under a tight deadline. But when your code fails, you can lose valuable time trying to investigate why. For that reason, some programmers suggest that you can’t afford to NOT write tests.

Either way, you’ll likely have to address your experience with test-driven development in job interviews. If you find it tedious, just be honest about your level of experience. You can explain that you’ve implemented it in a few projects, that you appreciate the safety net it provides, and that you’re eager to learn about implementing it in an enterprise application. 

### Look to the Future

Being able to write object-oriented JavaScript and test your code effectively is an important skill set to demonstrate to prospective employers. You should have at least one GitHub repository that implements both of these approaches.

If you enjoyed writing tests this week, consider working in **quality assurance**, or **QA**. QA developers aren’t just test writers&mdash;they’re responsible for a number of components in the software development cycle, including the following:

- **Validation**&mdash;writing master plans for the entire application and approving test criteria for validating a product and its process.

- **Documentation**&mdash;writing and controlling documentation of software development and implementing change and QA procedures.

- **Quality**&mdash;ensuring that all software and code is high-quality and follows applicable company standards.

- **Improvement**&mdash;developing and implementing quality-improvement plans.

If this sparks your interest, navigate to Indeed.com and search for key terms like “QA developer,” “QA tester,” “quality assurance,” or “QA analyst.”

### Technical Interview Preparation

Many companies use algorithm questions during the technical interview. We strongly recommend that you practice these. Doing so will prepare you to handle some of the most common questions in an interview or promotion discussion.

Please refer to the class repository to find these algorithms:

- Coding Algorithm #1: Linear Search

- Coding Algorithm #2: Is Unique

- Coding Algorithm #3: Is Anagram

For practice in a live, interview-style IDE, complete the following algorithm challenge. The solution will be discussed in the weekly recommended session.

Once you start, you'll have seven days to complete it. After seven days, the challenge will close.

- CodeSignal Algorithm: [Next Prime](https://app.codesignal.com/public-test/7wsdGsoYtdM8narY9/j2q8xRbzqXKT8k)

If you're interested in hearing more about the technical interviewing process and practicing algorithms in a mock interview setting, attend one of our [upcoming workshops](https://careernetwork.2u.com/?utm_medium=Academics&utm_source=boot_camp)!
