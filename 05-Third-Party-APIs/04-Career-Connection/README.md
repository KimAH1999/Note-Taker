## Career Connection

Welcome to another Career Connection! And congratulations on completing even more intense material, during which jQuery became a new friend. 

You might come across articles that question whether anyone should still learn jQuery in this day and age. Although jQuery was originally developed to do what JavaScript couldn't, by now JavaScript has developed and introduced many of the features that popularized jQuery. 

However, while some folks might regard jQuery as a relic of the early 2000s, many websites around the world still use it. Companies have invested in jQuery for years, and many still use systems written with it. Refactoring these into newer frameworks would be costly and often unnecessary, because the systems work and the developers are comfortable with the codebase.

You might ask why, as a new developer, you can't use newer frameworks. You can! But even if your first development job allows you to write programs using newer frameworks, you might find yourself having to maintain or write new features for legacy jQuery applications. Or you might end up working for a company that still actively uses jQuery.

At the end of the day, jQuery can still make a website more dynamic with beautiful effects and animations, and it enables you to manipulate the appearance and content of almost any element on the page&mdash;so accept it, embrace it, and add it to your repertoire.

### Becoming Employer-Competitive

Now take these two steps to make yourself more employer-competitive:

#### Step #1: Use jQuery in Your Portfolio

Enhance your portfolio using jQuery. Can you animate something using the [jQuery animation library](https://api.jquery.com/animate/)? Or you might choose to implement another jQuery functionality that you've learned this week.

#### Step #2: Add jQuery to Your Resume

The Technical Skills section of your resume should now proudly display jQuery next to HTML and CSS. Like we discussed, companies use jQuery all the time&mdash;so let them know that you can dance the jQuery jig!

### Look to the Future

As we always do, let's take a minute to prepare for your future as a full-stack web developer. 

#### Understand jQuery Demand

Head over to [LinkedIn Jobs](https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/). Poke around a bit to get comfortable with the site. Then complete the following tasks:

1. Search for jQuery jobs in your current location.

2. Note the number of search results returned.

3. Choose at least three job postings and read about the roles and how they use jQuery.

### Prepare for the Technical Interview

Many companies use algorithm questions during the technical interview. We strongly recommend that you practice for these. Doing so will prepare you to handle some of the most common questions in an interview or promotion discussion. 

Please refer to the class repository to find the following algorithms:

- Coding Algorithm #1: Fizz Buzz

- Coding Algorithm #2: Max Num

- Coding Algorithm #3: Vowel Count

For practice in a live, interview-style IDE complete the following algorithm challenge.

- CodeSignal Algorithm: [Reverse Sentence](https://app.codesignal.com/public-test/qL7KK4o6KBSgmdqBw/rDz464zXxdE6dx)

Once you start, you'll have seven days to complete it. After seven days, the challenge will close. The solution will be discussed in the weekly recommended session.

### Career Services Events

To learn more about the technical interviewing process and practice algorithms in a mock interview setting, attend one of our [upcoming workshops](https://careernetwork.2u.com/?utm_medium=Academics&utm_source=boot_camp)!
