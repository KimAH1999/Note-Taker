# 08 Project 1: Professional Materials

If you are opting out of career services, this is *still a required assignment*. Part of being a web developer means being a part of a community. Having a place to share your projects is *necessary* if you're applying for jobs, but it's also *critical* on your journey as a developer.

## Homework Requirements

* Updated portfolio featuring Project 1 and two exemplary homework assignments.

* Updated GitHub profile with pinned repositories featuring Project 1 and two exemplary assignments.

* Updated resume

* Updated LinkedIn profile

## Updated Portfolio

üíÅ Need help updating your Portfolio? Check out the [career services milestone resources for online presence](https://mycareerspot.org/onlinepresence).

Your updated portfolio should:

1. Display your contact information. If you don't want to share your personal email or phone number, use a separate email that you will only use for coding, also known as a developer email, and/or a call forwarding service, such as [Google Voice](https://voice.google.com/).

2. Have links to your GitHub profile and LinkedIn profile

3. Have a link to a downloadable PDF of your resume

4. Display at least 2 examples of student work from either deployed projects or homeworks. For each project, make sure you have the following:

	* Project title

	* Link to the deployed version

	* Link to the GitHub repository

	* Screenshot of the deployed application

5. Have a polished, mobile-responsive user interface.

### Design

Unfortunately, this is where it gets a little bit subjective. Your site should look
"polished." Here are a few guidelines on what that means:

* Mobile-first design

* Choose a color palette for your site so it doesn't just look like the default bootstrap theme or an unstyled HTML site.

* Make sure the font size is large enough to read, and that the colors don't cause eye strain.

## Updated GitHub Profile 

Employers (and potential collaborators) _will_ look at your GitHub profile, so put your best face forward. 

Your GitHub profile must contain at least the following items:

1. Profile picture or avatar

  * A photo or an avatar other than the default Github identicon. (a semi-professional to professional photo or an avatar photo are preferred)

2. Biography

3. Email address. If you don't want to share your personal email or phone number, use a developer email.

4. Link to your deployed portfolio

5. At least 2 pinned repositories:

	* Navigate to [GitHub](https://github.com/) and go to your profile.

	* Click "Customize your pins"

	* Click the checkboxes for your project and 2-3 homework assignments that you would like to share

6. Follow a few of your classmates and/or other developers. They are the beginning of your professional network and being a developer is as much about being a part of the community as it is writing code.

7. README files. Every pinned project should contain a README file with:

	* Title of app

	* Live link to deployed app

	* List of technologies used

	* 1-2 sentences explaining what the app is

	* 2-3 Screenshots / gifs of the app

	* License (usually MIT)
	
	* Contact information for you and any collaborators

8. Commit history. Every pinned repository should have at least 20 commits.
