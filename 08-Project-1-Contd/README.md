# Unit 08: Project 1 Continued

## Overview

Welcome to the second week of Project 1! This week, you will continue to work on your group project to build a front-end web application from scratch. As you wrap up your project, be prepared to give a presentation during the last class day of this unit. Use the [Project Presentation Template](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/10QaO9KH8HtUXj__81ve0SZcpO5DbMbqqQr4iPpbwKks/edit?usp=sharing) to prepare for the presentation. 

You will also update your professional materials, including your portfolio, GitHub profile, resume, and LinkedIn profile.

## Key Topics

The following topics will be covered in this unit:

* [Server-side APIs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_API)

* [Git branching workflow](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Branching-Branching-Workflows)

* [Agile software development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development)

## Learning Objectives

You will be employer-ready if you are able to:

* Speak technically about a feature you implemented in your project

* Explain and execute git branching workflow in a collaborative project

* Resolve merge conflicts

* Explain agile software development

* Design, build, and deploy a client-side web application using GitHub Pages

* Prepare a professional presentation and repository README for your project

## Homework

For this week's homework, you'll finish your project and give a presentation on it in class. Then you'll update your portfolio page and other professional materials to build towards being employer-competitive.

If you are opting out of career services, this is **still a required assignment**. Part of being a web developer means being a part of a community. Having a place to share your projects is necessary if you're applying for jobs, but it's also critical on your journey as a developer.

## Career Connection

Career services material for this unit is located in the [Career Connection folder](./04-Career-Connection/README.md). For more information about career services, including coding milestones, demo days, technical toolkits, workshops, and additional resources, visit the [career services website](https://careernetwork.2u.com/?utm_medium=Academics&utm_source=boot_camp/).

## Heads-Up
