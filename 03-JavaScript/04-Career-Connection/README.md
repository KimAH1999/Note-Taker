# Career Connection

## Career Connection

Now you've learned some of the fundamental technologies on which all web applications are built. And you've added another tool to your skill set: JavaScript! Never underestimate the importance of JavaScript as a web technology. More than 94% of websites use it in some way. To learn more, read this Medium article [How Important is JavaScript for Modern Web Developers?](https://medium.com/@mindfiresolutions.usa/how-important-is-javascript-for-modern-web-developers-2854309b9f52)

If you search for JavaScript on [Indeed.com](https://indeed.com/), you'll find hundreds, if not thousands, of search results. However, a search for JavaScript alone won't paint an accurate picture of job availability. JavaScript development is continuous, with numerous other technologies evolving and deriving from it, so companies might instead list frameworks or libraries that use JavaScript.

You don't need to understand what a framework or library is right now. Just know that you can also search any of the following terms for valid JavaScript job postings:

* NodeJS

* Express

* React

* Angular

* Vue

* jQuery

We'll teach you some of these technologies in this course, and you'll come to understand what all of them are. The bottom line is that JavaScript has invaded basically every area of web development!

### Becoming Employer-Competitive

Here's what you can do right now to become employer-competitive:

#### Add JavaScript as a Skill on Your Resume

The Technical Skills section of your resume should now proudly display JavaScript next to HTML and CSS. Most well-designed webpages use JavaScript, so make sure that prospective employers know you can work with it.

### Look to the Future

This section provides two steps that can help you start preparing for that first developer job or the promotion that you've been eyeing.

#### Step #1: Understand a JavaScript Job Post

Pull up that page from when you searched for JavaScript on [Indeed.com](https://indeed.com/), and record your answers to the following questions:

* What job titles did you find?

* Do you notice any differences between them?

* Which libraries and frameworks are companies looking for?

Some of the most common job titles you'll encounter in programming include Web Application Developer, Back-End Developer, Front-End Developer, Web Developer, and of course, Full-Stack Web Developer.

#### Step #2: Develop Your JavaScript Skills

You want to get better at JavaScript, but how do you know where to start? As a beginner, you might find it difficult to filter through the vast amount of JavaScript resources on the internet. 

Try the following approach to get started:

1. Review the module projects that you've completed.

2. Look for areas where you can improve and optimize your code. Where can you add additional code and features?

3. Starting this week, complete the algorithms in the following Technical Interview Preparation section. These crucial exercises represent the kind of questions you'll see in technical interviews.

4. If you want algorithm practice beyond these Career Connection lessons, try the following resources:

   * [HackerRank Interview Preparation Kit](https://www.hackerrank.com/interview/interview-preparation-kit)

   * [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/js/)

   * [CodeWars](https://www.codewars.com/)

### Prepare for the Technical Interview

Many companies use algorithm questions during the technical interview. We strongly recommend that you practice these. Doing so will prepare you to handle some of the most common questions in an interview or promotion discussion. 

Please refer to the class repository to find these algorithms:

* Coding Algorithm #1: Arithmetic

* Coding Algorithm #2: Odd or Even

* Coding Algorithm #3: Log Nums

For practice in a live, interview-style IDE, complete the following algorithm challenge. The solution will be discussed in the weekly recommended session.

Once you start, you'll have seven days to complete it. After seven days, the challenge will close.
