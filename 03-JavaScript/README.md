# Unit 03: JavaScript

## Overview

We've already explored how to structure webpages with HTML and style them with CSS. This week, with the help of JavaScript, we will learn how to make webpages dynamic.

**JavaScript** is a widely used scripting language that adds functionality and interactivity to a webpage. Building on a static HTML framework and CSS styling, with JavaScript you can store information in variables, manipulate your HTML, respond to an event, play audio and video, add decision-making to your code, and do much more. 

As the only programming language native to web browsers, JavaScript is used all over the web&mdash;making it a crucial skill in your toolbox. But Javascript development skills are also versatile. Once you have mastered JavaScript, it is much easier to pick up the fundamentals of other programming languages. 

## Key Topics

The following topics will be covered in this unit:

 * [`<script>` tags](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/script)

 * [Variables](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/var)

 * [Primitive types](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Primitive)
 
 * [Logical and comparison operators](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Expressions_and_Operators)
 
 * [Conditional statements](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/if...else)
 
 * [Arrays](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array)
 
 * [Array methods](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array#Instance_methods)

 * [String methods](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String#Instance_methods)
 
 * [Objects](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object)
 
 * [Object methods](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Working_with_Objects#Defining_methods)

 * [`this` keyword](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/this)

## Learning Objectives

You will be employer-ready if you are able to: 

* Implement complex decision-making in your code using `if` and `if-else` statements. 

* Explain the difference between equality (`==`) and strict equality (`===`). 

* Store related data in an array and use array methods to mutate and perform operations on the array. 

* Explain functions and how they are used in JavaScript.

* Explain the difference between function declarations and function expressions. 

* Recognize whether a variable is locally or globally scoped and explain the difference.

* Create objects and use object methods. 

* Use the keyword `var` to declare a variable. 

## Technical Interview Preparation

You will be employer-competitive if you are able to solve the following algorithms and successfully complete the assessments.

### Algorithms

Practicing algorithm-based interview questions is one of the best ways to prepare for interviews. Watch the ðŸ“¹ Let's Code video(s) for tips and tricks on how to solve the algorithms.

* [01: Arithmetic](03-Algorithms/01-arithmetic)

* [02: Odd or Even](03-Algorithms/02-odd-or-even)

  * [ðŸ“¹ Let's Code Odd or Even!](https://2u-20.wistia.com/medias/bnqjr1owj7)

* [03: Log Nums](03-Algorithms/03-log-nums)

### Assessments

Assess your knowledge by answering technical interview questions and solving coding challenges.

## Homework 

You'll create an application that generates a random password based on user-selected criteria. This app will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by your JavaScript code. It will also feature a clean and polished user interface and be responsive, ensuring that it adapts to multiple screen sizes.
