# 📖 Link External JavaScript File to Existing HTML File

Work with a partner to implement the following user story:

* As a developer, I want to link an external JavaScript file to an existing `index.html` file to add JavaScript functionality to my static webpage. 

## Acceptance Criteria

* It's done when I open the `index.html` file, navigate to the console, and see the message contained in the `script.js` file logged to the console. 

## 📝 Notes

Refer to the documentation: 

[MDN Web Docs on the script element](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/script)

[Google documentation on opening Chrome DevTools](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/open)

## 💡 Hints

It is best practice to add a link to an external JavaScript file above what closing HTML tag? 

## 🏆 Bonus

If you have completed this activity, work through the following challenge with your partner to further your knowledge:

* Comments are a key part of a developer's toolbox. Why do you think it is so important to include comments in your code? How do you write single-line and multiline comments in Javascript?

Use [Google](https://www.google.com) or another search engine to research this.
