# 🐛 Messages Not Logging to Console 

Work with a partner to resolve the following issue(s):

* Users should see a message log to the console indicating whether the shelter dog or cat is available.

## Expected Behavior

When a name is stored in the `chosenPet` variable, a message should log to the console indicating whether the pet is available and whether it is a dog or a cat. If the pet is not available, a message should indicate that and suggest the shelter's featured cat and dog. No errors should be returned. 

## Actual Behavior

No message is logged to the console, and an error message indicating an `Uncaught ReferenceError` is returned. 

## 💡 Hints

Look at each console log. What is the intended input? How can you use the object name and key to access the values and methods you need to make the code work? 

## 🏆 Bonus

If you have completed this activity, work through the following challenge with your partner to further your knowledge:

* How can you convert an object into an array using `Object.values()`?
