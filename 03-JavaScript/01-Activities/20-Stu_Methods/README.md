# üìñ Implement Array and String Methods

Work with a partner to implement the following user stories:

* As a developer, I want to use array methods to add and remove elements from an array and join two arrays.

* As a developer, I want to use a string method to return a new string that contains only capital letters. 

## Acceptance Criteria

* It's done when the string `"Canis Major"` is added as the first element of the `constellations` array and no elements are removed. 

* It's done when `"Venus"` is removed from the `planets` array.

* It's done when the arrays `constellations` and `planets` are joined to form a new array named `galaxy`. The arrays `constellations` and `planets` should not be altered.

* It's done when the string `"polaris"` is converted into all capital letters and the new string is stored in a variable.

## üìù Notes

Refer to the documentation:

[MDN Web Docs on array instance methods](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array#Instance_methods)

[MDN Web Docs on string instance methods](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String#Instance_methods)

## üèÜ Bonus

If you have completed this activity, work through the following challenge with your partner to further your knowledge:

* What happens when you use `typeof` on an array? What is returned? Is that what you expected? Why or why not? 

Use [Google](https://www.google.com) or another search engine to research this.
