# Unit 11: Express.js

## Overview

In this unit, we'll use Express.js, a widely used Node.js framework, to handle different HTTP methods in an API route. Well-designed routes help us handle responses when a client makes requests to a specific endpoint or URL. Previously, we used the Fetch API on the front end to make GET requests to third-party APIs. During this unit, we expand to using the Fetch API to make POST requests to an API that we create. We'll learn how client-side requests are related to server-side responses. Let's get started!

## Key Topics

The following topics will be covered in this unit:

* [Server setup and sendFile](https://expressjs.com/en/starter/hello-world.html)

* [API vs. HTML routes](https://expressjs.com/en/guide/routing.html#response-methods)

* [req.query and params](https://expressjs.com/en/guide/routing.html#route-parameters)

* [GET with Fetch API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API/Using_Fetch)

* [Middleware for static assets](http://expressjs.com/en/starter/static-files.html)

* [Insomnia](https://support.insomnia.rest/article/11-getting-started)

* [POST requests and routes](https://expressjs.com/en/starter/basic-routing.html)

* [Middleware for body parsing](http://expressjs.com/en/api.html#req.body)

* [POST with Fetch API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API/Using_Fetch)

* [Data persistence using JSON](https://nodejs.org/api/fs.html#fs_file_system)

* [Modular routing](http://expressjs.com/en/guide/routing.html#express-router)

* [Custom middleware](https://expressjs.com/en/guide/writing-middleware.html)

* [Heroku deployment](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/getting-started-with-nodejs?singlepage=true)

## Learning Objectives

You will be employer-ready if you are able to:

* Configure an Express.js app to handle GET and POST requests.

* Configure an Express.js app to serve static files.

* Identify how client-side requests relate to server-side responses.

* Parse optional and required parameters when creating server-side routes.

* Implement client-side POST requests to submit form data to a server.

* Implement separation of concerns for routing.

## Technical Interview Preparation

You will be employer-competitive if you are able to solve the following algorithms and successfully complete the assessments.

### Algorithms

Practicing algorithm-based interview questions is one of the best ways to prepare for interviews. Watch the `ðŸ“¹ Let's Code` video(s) for tips and tricks on how to solve the algorithm.

## Homework

For this week's homework, you'll create an application using Express.js and persistent storage that will allow users to take notes via a web interface. You'll create POST and GET routes to add and retrieve notes from persistent storage. The application will feature a sleek interface and demonstrate your knowledge of Express.js and routing. You'll also deploy the Note Taker application to Heroku using the Heroku CLI.
