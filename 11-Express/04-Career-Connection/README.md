# Career Connection

## Career Connection

Now you're getting familiar with Express.js, a framework for creating server-side APIs using Node.js. Equipped with Express.js, you can now create a full-stack application with both a client and a server backed by a MySQL database. That's exciting&mdash;and a phenomenal change from when you were creating sites with just HTML and CSS.

### Express.js in the Workplace

Node.js has stirred up a lot of buzz in the development world, becoming one of the most popular server-side programming languages. And it is even more powerful when used with Express.js, so it is quickly being adopted for enterprise-level applications. But what does that mean?

**Enterprise applications** assist companies in solving business problems. They differ from hobby or development applications in that they’re held to a higher standard of quality control, with more end users.

Traditionally, languages like Node.js and Ruby have been used primarily for hobby development. On the other hand, until recently, more established languages like C# and Java were reserved for enterprise applications because of their proven robustness. They've been tried and tested, and they work.

However, more and more companies are now rewriting the code for their enterprise applications in different languages&mdash;for example, Walmart, NASA, Intel, and Twitter use Node.js.

Coding an enterprise application in Node.js can have the following advantages:

* Speeds up development by allowing you to code both the server and front end in JavaScript.

* Reduces the number of developers needed.

* Provides developers with a wide range of tools and libraries.

* Makes code execution extremely fast.

If asked in an interview why you might want to write Node.js code for an enterprise application, you can cite any of the preceding advantages; you can also point out that it is a particularly great fit for microservices, which are a popular format for large enterprise applications.

### Looking to the Future

Now that you’ve picked up more technologies beyond the basics -- including frameworks like Express.js and Node.js -- you should be sure to add them to your resume. Your resume is usually your first chance to impress a potential employer with your skills and accomplishments. An employer-competitive resume focuses on results and uses dynamic language. It should be organized, visually clean, and mistake free.

For this section, visit the [MyCareerSpot page on developing your resume](https://mycareerspot.org/resume) and get working on that employer-competitive resume!

### Technical Interview Preparation

Many companies use algorithm questions during the technical interview. We strongly recommend that you practice these. Doing so will prepare you to handle some of the most common questions in an interview or promotion discussion.

Please refer to the class repository to find these algorithms:

* Coding Algorithm #1: Most Songs in Playlist

* Coding Algorithm #2: Is Perfect Square

* Coding Algorithm #3: Array Search 2D

For practice in a live, interview-style IDE, complete the following algorithm challenge. The solution will be discussed in the weekly recommended session.

Once you start, you'll have seven days to complete it. After seven days, the challenge will close.

* CodeSignal Algorithm: [Add One](https://app.codesignal.com/public-test/ThqFTjkqwzQrcoqKB/AhsPkH8G6H8qqi)

If you're interested in hearing more about the technical interviewing process and practicing algorithms in a mock-interview setting, attend one of our [upcoming workshops](https://careernetwork.2u.com/?utm_medium=Academics&utm_source=boot_camp)!
