# 📖 Implement Modular Routes

Work with a partner to implement the following user story:

* As a developer, I want to modularize my route logic from the rest of my server so that I can separate concerns appropriately. 

## Acceptance Criteria

* It's done when the routes in `server.js` are broken into modules based on different endpoints.

* It's done when I have created a `routes` directory to hold my route files.

* It's done when I have created a `tipsRouter.js` file that uses express.Router.

* It's done when I have created a `feedbackRouter.js` file that also uses express.Router.

* It's done when I have created an `index.js` file that imports all my router files.

* It's done when I have required my `routes.js` file inside my `server.js` file.

## 📝 Notes

Refer to the documentation:

[Express.js documentation on express.Router](http://expressjs.com/en/guide/routing.html#express-router)
