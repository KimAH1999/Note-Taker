# 🏗️ Implement Express.js Routing

Work with a partner to implement the following user story:

## Acceptance Criteria

* It's done when I have created an `app` variable set to the value of `express()`.

* It's done when I have set up middleware to serve static files from `/public`.

* It's done when I have created an HTML route to serve up `paths.html`.
