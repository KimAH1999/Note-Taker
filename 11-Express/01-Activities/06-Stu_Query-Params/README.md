# 📐 Add Comments to Implementation of Query Parameters

Work with a partner to add comments describing the functionality of the code found in [Unsolved](./Unsolved/server.js).

## 📝 Notes

How are route parameters denoted when building route paths?

How can we chain multiple parameters together in the same path? 

Refer to the documentation: 

[Express.js documentation on query parameters](http://expressjs.com/en/guide/routing.html#route-paths)
