# üìñ Deploy an Express.js App to Heroku

Work with a partner to implement the following user story:

* As a web developer, I want to deploy my application to services like Heroku so that I can share my app with the world.

## Acceptance Criteria

* It's done when I have initialized a Git repository by running `git init` at the root of my existing project.

* It's done when I have modified the `PORT` variable in `server.js` according to the Heroku documentation.

* It's done when I have created a new Heroku app using the Heroku CLI.

* It's done when I have verified that the Heroku remote URL was added using the appropriate Git command.

* It's done when I have added and committed all my files and pushed to Heroku.

* It's done after I have confirmed that the application was deployed successfully by running `heroku open`.

## üìù Notes

How can you use the command `heroku logs --tail` to troubleshoot deployment errors?

## üèÜ Bonus

If you have completed this activity, work through the following challenge with your partner to further your knowledge:

* When you created your Heroku account, you might have seen the [Heroku dashboard](https://dashboard.heroku.com/). What useful information can you learn about your application from this page?

Use [Google](https://www.google.com) or another search engine to research this.
