# 🏗️ Query Express.js App Using Insomnia

Work with a partner to implement the following user story:

* As a developer, I want to use Insomnia to test endpoints that I created using Express.js, to debug my API.

## Acceptance Criteria

* It's done when I have required the `db.json` file in the server.js file.

* It's done when I have created a variable called `app` in the server.js file that is an instance of the Express.js app.

* It's done when I have created a `GET` route for `/api` that will return the content of our json file.

* It's done when I have tested my endpoint by performing a `GET` request to `/api` using Insomnia.

## 💡 Hints

Do we need to pass a request body to the server when we are using query parameters?

How can the [GitHub Docs on pulls](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/reference/pulls) help us with usage?

## 🏆 Bonus

If you have completed this activity, work through the following challenge with your partner to further your knowledge:

* How can you save multiple request URLs in Insomnia?

Use [Google](https://www.google.com) or another search engine to research this.
