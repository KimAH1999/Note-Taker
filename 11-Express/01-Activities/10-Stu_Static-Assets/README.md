# 📖  Implement Middleware for Static Assets

Work with a partner to implement the following user story:

* As a web developer, I want to automatically serve all static assets using middleware so that I don't need to create a specific GET route for each file.

## Acceptance Criteria

* It's done when I have set up middleware to serve all static files in Express.js.

* It's done when I have used the `express.static()` method to declare the root directory to serve assets from.

* It's done when I have used the `express.static()` method (inside the `app.use()` method) for granting access to the `public` folder assets.

## 📝 Notes

Refer to the documentation:

[Express.js documentation on serving static files](http://expressjs.com/en/starter/static-files.html)

## 💡 Hints

How would we use routes to access the contents of a directory nested inside the `public` directory?

## 🏆 Bonus

If you have completed this activity, work through the following challenge with your partner to further your knowledge:

* What are other examples of middleware in Express.js?

Use [Google](https://www.google.com) or another search engine to research this.
