# 🐛 Link and Button Placement is Incorrect

Work with a partner to resolve the following issues:

* As a user, I want the navigation links to be on the right side.

* As a user, I want the slideshow buttons to be sized as smaller icons and centered alongside the image.

## Expected Behavior

The navigation links are aligned to the right. The slideshow buttons are smaller than the image and are centered alongside the image.

## Actual Behavior

The navigation links are aligned to the left. The slideshow buttons extend to the same height as the image.

## Assets

The following image demonstrates the web application's appearance:
