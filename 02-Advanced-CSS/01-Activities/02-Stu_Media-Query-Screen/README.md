# üèóÔ∏è Implement Media Queries for Screens

Work with a partner to implement the following user story:

* As an online shopper, I want to view products clearly on my mobile phone as well as my computer.

## Acceptance Criteria

* It's done when the screen size is larger than 992px and the product cards on the screen are side by side.

* It's done when I change the screen size to 992px or smaller, and the product cards on the screen split into two columns.

* It's done when I change the screen size to 768px or smaller, and the product cards on the screen become stacked on top of each other.

* Optional: Just for fun, change the background color of the header each time the product cards change layout. 

## Assets
