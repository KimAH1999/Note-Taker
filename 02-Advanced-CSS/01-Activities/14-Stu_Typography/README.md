# üìñ Implement Typographic Styles

Work with a partner to implement the following user story:

* As a user, I want to read a blog that uses visually appealing font styles.

## Acceptance Criteria

* It's done when the body font has the standard size of 16px.

* It's done when paragraphs have a line height of 1.5 times the font height.

* It's done when headings are 150‚Äì200% of the font size and have a font family of `serif`.

* It's done when there is a margin of 2‚Äì5% on the heading, paragraph, and list.

* It's done when the list is indented, has square bullet points, and has a font family of `monospace`.

* Working with CSS should be a creative experience for you! Your end product should look as close to the solution as possible, but feel free to try out other looks!

## üí° Hints

* What values for `font-weight` and `font-style` can you use to give the page a more personal touch?

## üèÜ Bonus

If you have completed the activity and want to further your knowledge, work through the following challenge with your partner:

* What are some other options for web fonts besides the given basic fonts?

Use [Google](https://www.google.com) or another search engine to research this.
