# Career Connection

## Career Connection

Welcome, welcome! Congratulations&mdash;you've now added advanced CSS to your skill set, in addition to the HTML and CSS that you learned previously. 

CSS is one of those technologies that developers tend to either love or hate. Whichever side you're on, the cold hard truth is that every developer must use it. Even back-end developers will occasionally be asked to quickly put together interfaces for their applications to demonstrate how they work. 

### Becoming Employer-Competitive

Before we dive into the types of CSS questions that you might see in an interview, let's work on a couple of tasks that will push you closer to being employer-competitive: enhancing your portfolio and updating your resume. 

> **Important:** Having the skills is not enough. You need to let potential employers know what you know!

#### Step #1: Add Some Custom Styling to Your Portfolio

It often helps to look at other portfolios for color and layout inspiration. Here are some design websites to check out:

* [Dribbble.com](https://dribbble.com/): A great resource for design inspiration

* [OnePageLove](https://onepagelove.com/): One-page landing page inspiration

* [FlatUIcolors.com](https://flatuicolors.com/): Helps you find a group of colors that play nicely together

#### Step #2: Add CSS as a Skill on Your Resume

In the technical skills section of your resume, CSS should be proudly displayed next to HTML. Add it now if you didn't already do it in last week's Career Connection. This week, add Responsive Design to that list of skills as well.

### Look to the Future

The best thing to do to get ready for that technical interview is to start practicing advanced CSS today. This section contains some ideas for projects that you can build right now with the skills you've learned so far. This is an opportunity to practice your coding skills, start building your portfolio, and engage with the GitHub community&mdash;all very important steps to becoming employer-competitive right now! 

You don't have to follow these ideas exactly&mdash;feel free to add your own creativity and flair. Here's the list: 

* **A tribute or celebration page of a favorite person**

    This requires working with HTML to create a simple layout, ordered and unordered lists, images, and CSS to make it look sleek and professional.

* **Application registration page**

    Forms on the internet can be quite boring, so use this as an opportunity to re-imagine what a form should look like! Your registration page should include inputs for first name, last name, email (which validates as an email address), password (which should be obscured), confirm password (again, obscure it), and a submit button. Feel free to add any other items you can think of!

* **Google Search clone**

    Using HTML and CSS, see if you can re-create the design of the Google search page. We're just going for the visual here; it doesn't need to be a functional search form.

> **Important:** Don't forget to put these on your GitHub as you complete them! 

### Prepare for the Technical Interview

Many companies introduce algorithm questions during the technical interview. When we learn JavaScript, we'll throw out various algorithm questions to get you up to speed. This week, we'll focus on common CSS interview questions. 

For each of the following questions, write down your answer before looking at the solution.

*   **Where can styles be defined?**

    * Inline&mdash;used to style only a small piece of code: `<div style="background-color: #cc0000"> This is a section </div>`

    * Embedded&mdash;style sheets are put inside the `<head>` element in between the `<style>` tags. For example, `<style> div{ background-color: #cc0000 } </style>`

    * External&mdash;style rules are defined in a separate file and linked from the HTML file using `<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="./assets/css/app.css" />`

*   **What is a selector and what are the different types of selectors you can use?**

    A selector is used to select an element and apply styles to it. Here's a list of selectors: 

     * Class: `.someClass { color: red }`
     * ID: `#someId { color: red }`
     * Type: `p{ color: red }`
     * Attribute: `p[href="https://myportfolio.com"] { color: red }`
     * Pseudo-class: `div:first-child { color: red }`
     * Pseudo-element: `div::after { height: 300px; }`

*   **What are the advantages of external style sheets?**

    * Classes can be reused in multiple style sheets and HTML documents.

    * You can control multiple styles from one source of truth (i.e., one CSS document).

*   **Is there anything you dislike about CSS?**

    This one doesn't have a right or wrong answer. Developers have opinions, and prospective employers want to know that you do too. List two or three things you found difficult or irritating about learning CSS, and describe how you overcame those.
