# 📖 Implement the Location Web API to Redirect 404 Errors

Work with a partner to implement the following user story:

* As a developer, I want to direct users to a different page if there is an error.

## Acceptance Criteria

* It's done when I make a `fetch()` request that results in a 404 status, and the browser redirects to `404.html`.

## 📝 Notes

Refer to the documentation: 

[MDN Web Docs on location.replace](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Location/replace)

## 💡 Hints

What object does `location.replace` belong to? What are relative paths?

## 🏆 Bonus

If you have completed this activity, work through the following challenge with your partner to further your knowledge:

* Sometimes APIs don't return JSON; they can return other data formats like XML. How can you convert XML to JSON?

Use [Google](https://www.google.com) or another search engine to research this.
